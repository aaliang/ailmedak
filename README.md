# ailmedak
ailmedak is kademlia spelled backwards!

Ailmedak is a collection of libraries and protocols to spin up massively available distributed hash tables. It is inspired by Kademlia proposed by Petar Maymounkov and  David Mazi√®res.

Included is a binary to start a DHT node within a 160-bit namespace and a default k-factor of 8. Both of these can be tuneable (though the namespace size must be specified at compile time)
Ailmedak's long term goal is to be almost exclusively stack-based. While this may be useful for extremely stringent performance requirements (but probably not) and/or in embedded systems the true reason behind this is because forcing no dynamic memory is a fun challenge :)

This is still a work in progress!

This is currently just a P system in terms of CAP theorem. It will eventually become AP

## requirements
platform: Unix/Linux
rust 1.5.0
optional: elixir, erlang for some scripts

## starting a node
with cargo:
```cargo run --bin main -- -p 3444 -a 8000```
from binary:
```./main -p 3444 -a 8000```
